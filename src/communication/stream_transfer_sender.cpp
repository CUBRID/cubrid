/*
 * stream_transfer_[sender/receiver].cpp
 *
 * - sends or receives chunks(usually MTU bytes) from cubstream::stream
 * - the sender interogates the respective stream and tries to send the minimum between MTU and what is left of
 *   the stream
 * - it contains a daemon that is started automatically at creation, that does the task of sending/receiving bytes
 * - usage can be found in transfer_channel/test_main.cpp;
 *   on one machine will exist a transfer_sender instance and on the other a transfer_receiver.
 *   the instances are created using consumer/producer streams and connected communication channels.
 *   the stream will be sent automatically until m_last_reported_ready_pos
