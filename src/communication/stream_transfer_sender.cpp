/*
 * stream_transfer_[sender/receiver].cpp
 *
 * - sends or receives chunks(usually MTU bytes) from cubstream::stream
 * - the sender interogates the respective stream and tries to send the minimum between MTU and what is left of
 *   the stream
 * - it contains a daemon that is started automatically at creation, that does the task of sending/receiving bytes
 * - usage can be found in transfer_channel/test_main.cpp;
 *   on one machine will exist a transfer_sender instance and on the other a transfer_receiver.
 *   the instances are created using consumer/producer streams and connected communication channels.
 *   the stream will be sent automatically until m_last_committed_pos
 *
 *   Termination :
 *    - some streams are infinite (they continuously send data until socket becomes invalid) or finite
 *    - a finite stream require an explicit termination phase :
 *      the user code of stream sender must use 'enter_termination_phase' of the sender object.
 *      this sets the sender into "receive" mode which expects the peer to either send something or
 *      simply close the connection
 *    - the stream receiver also has a 'terminate_connection' method which needs to be explicitly
 *      called by the user code
 *    - since stream and sender/receiver view the contents as bytes, the 'decision' to terminate the connection
 *      is taken at logical level (user code of stream/sender/receiver) ;
 *      for a finite stream, a logical 'end' packet (stream entry) could be send from sender side to receiver side;
 *      after decoding of this packet (which is ussualy asynchronous with sender/receive threads), the user must call
 *      sender->enter_termination_phase; on receiver side, after decoding the logical 'end' packet, the user code calls
 *      receiver->terminate_connection (this will close the connection, which is detected by sender side, which in turn
 *      is unblocked)
