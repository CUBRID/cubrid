 * Note :
 *    Grant information is stored packed in a sequence.  These
 *    macros define the length of the "elements" of the sequence and the
 *    offsets to particular fields in each element.  Previously, grants
 *    were stored in their own object but that lead to serious performance
 *    problems as we tried to load each grant object from the server.
 *    This way, grants are stored in the set directly with the authorization
 *    object so only one fetch is required.
