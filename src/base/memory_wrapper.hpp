/* ***IMPORTANT!!***
 * memory_wrapper.hpp has a restriction that it must locate at the end of including section
 * because the user-defined new for overloaded format can make build error in glibc
 * when glibc header use "placement new" or another overloaded format of new.
 * So memory_wrapper.hpp cannot be included in header file, but memory_cwrapper.h can be included.
 * You can include memory_cwrapper.h in a header file when the header file use allocation function.
