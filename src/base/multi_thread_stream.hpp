   * the read, read_partial, read_serial, write require a function argument to perform custom write/read operation;
   * Interface:
   *
   * write (amount, write_function):
   *   - the amount needs to be pre-computed
   *   - internally, the write_function is wrapped by a reserve/commit pair
   *
   * read (pos, amount, read_function):
   *    - the position and amount of data are required
   *    - internally, the read_function is wrapped by start_read, end_read (for latching the page in buffer)
   *    - if required range is still in bip_buffer storage and it spans across the its boundary, the read
   *      creates internally a buffer and provides a copy of range to read_function
   *
   * read_serial (amount, read_function):
   *    - the stream stores an internal position for serial reading
   *    - this method must be used by only one thread
   *
   * read_partial (pos, amount, read_amount, read_function):
   *    - similar with read, but it provides only 'read_amount' in case of range spans across buffer boundary
   *
   * Internals:
   *  The reserved position are stored in a circular queue of stream_reserve_context elements.
   *  The memory storage is implemented using bip_buffer.
   *  reserve_with_buffer/commit_append : internal methods used by write;
   *  get_data_from_pos/unlatch_read_data : internal methods used by read;
   *  wait_for_data : used by read when requested range is not yet produced
