// lock-free transaction reclaimable nodes
//
//    Lock-free data structures needs to be tagged with a reclaimable node (by either derivation or composition).
//    When node is to be removed from structure, it is retired, collected by thread's transaction descriptor and
//    safely reclaimed later.
//
//    See lockfree_transaction_system.hpp description for an overview of the lock-free transaction implementation.
