##########################
#
# This is a sample locale configuration file, containing all locales
# supported by CUBRID.
#
# This file contains information regarding locales that are not available
# by default in CUBRID, but need to be compiled into shared libraries
# using CUBRID's 'make_locale' script.
#
#
# Each row corresponds to a single locale.
# The structure of each row must be as follows:
#  locale         LDML-file-path      library-file-path
# where:
#  locale = [mandatory] locale name (e.g. de_DE, fr_FR etc.)
#  LDML-file-path = [optional] file path to the XML LDML file corresponding
#                   to the locale. If missing or set to "*", the path
#                   $CUBRID/locales/data/ldml/cubrid_<locale>.xml is assumed.
#  library-file-path = [optional] path to the library containing the compiled
#                      version of the current locale. If missing or "*", the
#                      path $CUBRID/lib/libcubrid_<locale>.[dll|so] is assumed.
#                      (dll extension for Windows or so extension for Linux).
#                      If this path is not found, then the path
#                      $CUBRID/lib/libcubrid_all_locales.[dll|so] is assumed.
#
# CUBRID comes with a prepared set of LDML-based locales.
# The corresponding LDML files can be found in $CUBRID/locales/data/ldml.
