XMLRPC-EPI

This library is intended for use by those trying to implement XMLRPC 
support (http://www.xmlrpc.org) in their C programs.  It was written 
because the author could not find any fast, complete implementations of 
XMLRPC, most of them thus far having been written in interpreted 
languages.  It incorporates a few ideas from a previous C effort, 
Expat-Ensor.  See http://xml.ensor.org for more info on that project.  

It has been demonstrated fully compliant with the XMLRPC spec,
having passed the test suite at http://validator.xmlrpc.com.

NEW! Shared libexpat support

[unix systems]
With the autotools update the default option to build against a shared
libexpat has been added. The system will search /usr/include/ for expat/h
and /usr/lib/ for libexpat.* if you have these files in another location
please specifcy on the configure command line
./configure --with-expat=/location/to/expat

If your distro does not come with a libexpat, please get the latest 
version from http://expat.sourceforge.net

[windows systems]
Please download and install libexpat from http://expat.sourceforge.net, a
windows setup.exe is avaiable for download and the visual studio project files
are set to look in the location that the expat installer uses :-
C:\Program Files\Expat 2.0.1\

NEW! EXPERIMENTAL support for SOAP.

Experimental support for SOAP is now included. Both XMLRPC and SOAP
can be read/written by the library, and the application need not worry 
about it, IE, there is a single API that works for both, and the choice
is made at serialization time. When reading, the XML vocabulary will be
automatically detected.  For an example of using SOAP, see sample.c in 
the samples directory.  

Various iterations of this code have been/are running at 
Epinions.com and are sufficiently fast for the high traffic volume this 
site encounters, with several xmlrpc type requests generated for each user 
http request.  No specific speed claims are made.  Your mileage may vary.

If you have robodoc installed on your system, API Documentation can be 
generated from source like this:
 cd src
 make html
 lynx xmlrpc_mi.html

Sample programs are in ./sample.  See ./sample --help or the source files 
for more info on these.  

It is the author's hope that this code will be found useful by someone, 
and would like to hear about how and where it is being used, or 
suggestions for improvement.
